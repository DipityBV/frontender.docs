# Blueprints

A blueprint (definition) is like a container. Blueprints have controls that allow Frontender Desktop to render the configuration UI used to edit the container instructions (config). Blueprints are used as a template to create containers. They are preformatted to container useful default settings that can be overridden once they have been included onto a page.

Blueprints are created by clicking the <i class="fa fa-files-o"></i> icon in the right click menu of a page.  
You can update blueprints by clicking the `update blueprint` checkbox in the container settings menu.

<!-- @TODO Jeroen: is the following text still needed? -->

Blueprints are (JSON) definitions. These definitions contain instructions for the templates.

When blueprints are imported (uploaded into Frontender Platform) any referenced blueprints and/or assets (templates, css, js, media) may also be included in the extension package.

More information about blueprints can be found [here](/blueprints.html).
