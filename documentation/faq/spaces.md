##### How can I manage my space?
When a space is created, it will be directly related to a user. This user is considered the Space Administrator.  
The ownership of a space may be transferred to another user at any time.

A space can be related to other users as well. These users can have one of two roles:
* Space Administrator – All rights to manage all aspects of a space.
* Space Manager – (limited) Rights to manage low-level aspects of a space.
