# Glossary
An overview of terms used throughout the documentation.

**More detailed information about every term can be found below the table.**

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| [Adapter](#adapter) | An adapter is the gateway to the content. |
| [API](#api) | An API enables data access from an external client. |
| [Blueprint](#blueprints) | A JSON object containing the presets from which a container may be generated. |
| [Container](#container-blueprints) | A JSON object containing instructions to render a template. A container is the visual representation of a blueprint. |
| [Control](#control-blueprints) | A JSON object with instructions to render a field. Controls are very specialised, tiny snippets of JSON that Frontender Desktop uses to render its interface. |
| Definition | A JSON object with rendering instructions. |
| Dirty | A changed value or set of values (definition) that have not (yet) been persisted (saved). |
| [Extension Package](#extensions) | A collection of files needed for the import of an extension (blueprint, adapter or template). |
| Frontend | The frontend application. |
| Frontender desktop | Frontender, the Electron desktop application (FED) |
| Frontender Platform | The frontend application, a (collection of) site(s). |
| JSON | JavaScript Object Notation https://www.json.org/ |
| Locale | A language scope, includes time, date and currency in the localeâ€™s format. |
| Lot revisions | A collection of page, collection, blueprint or control definitions that have the same lot id. |
| Modules | A modules is a nested in container. |
| Page | Pages are collections of containers. In fact, a page is also a container. This JSON object will also contain a path attribute. |
| Path | A routable path to a page (e.g. "/blog"). |
| Revision | A stored, older version of a container. |
| Route | The path to a resource as displayed in the browser's address bar. |
| Space | A collection of sites and resources. Usually, a Space represents a (paying) client. There is also a global Space (frontendermanager.com?) that is used for smaller clients, comparable to wordpress.com. |
| [Template](#templates) | Templates render the containers in the browser. Templates contain layout and styling instructions. |

## Terms

###### Adapter
An adapter interacts directly with an API. An adapter is an extension package of:
- PHP Models, which extend/implement Frontender Platform core adapter models,
- Control blueprints, which are used inside container blueprints and are used to set the model states
Adapters have one or more models, any website can have multiple adapters.

###### API
In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication among various components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.

An API may be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware, or software library.

An API specification can take many forms, but often includes specifications for routines, data structures, object classes, variables, or remote calls. POSIX, Windows API and ASPI are examples of different forms of APIs. Documentation for the API usually is provided to facilitate usage and implementation.

###### Blueprints
Blueprints are (JSON) definitions. These definitions contain instructions for the templates and the adapters.

When blueprints are imported (uploaded into Frontender Platform) any referenced blueprints and/or assets (templates, CSS, JavaScript, media) may also be included in the extension package.

###### Container blueprints
Instructions for a single container.

###### Control blueprints
A special kind of blueprint that contains instructions on how to render a field to edit the attributes (values) of a container.

Controls are only used inside Frontender Desktop and are not included in the page.  
A list of basic Frontender Desktop controls can be found on the [controls page](/controls.html).

###### Extensions
Extensions are installable components. Components may be developed by Frontender or third parties.
We distinguish between three types of extensions:
1. Adapters
2. Blueprints
3. Templates

Extensions are considered a space asset. Extensions are managed from the Space Dashboard.
Extensions are available to all sites in a space. We may introduce extension management in a future version of Frontender (Desktop and Platform).

###### Page blueprints
Instructions for a page. Technically, they are identical to a container blueprint definition as a page is in fact also a container. A page blueprint contains a collection of other containers.

###### Templates
Templates are HTML instructions and may include other assets like CSS, JavaScript and Images. Templates are currently Twig files. Templates are stored in the space, but overrides on a site level may be supported in a future version.
