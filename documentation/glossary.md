## Terms

###### Frontender Desktop
Frontender Desktop is the Frontend Management System. It is a desktop application (OSX, Windows and Linux) with which webviews are created, edited and managed from a WYSIWYG User Interface.

###### Extensions
Extensions are installable components. Components may be developed by Frontender or 3rd parties.
We distinguish between three types of extensions:
1. Adapters
2. Blueprints
3. Templates

Extensions are considered a space asset. Extensions are managed from the Space Dashboard.
Extensions are available to all sites in a space. We may introduce extension management in a future version of Frontender (Desktop and Platform).

###### Blueprints
Blueprints are (JSON) definitions. These definitions contain instructions for the templates and the adapters.

When blueprints are imported (uploaded into Frontender Platform) any referenced blueprints and/or assets (templates, CSS, JavaScript, media) may also be included in the extension package.

###### Container blueprints
Instructions for a single container.

###### Page blueprints
Instructions for a page. Technically, they are identical to a container blueprint definition as a page is in fact also a container. A page blueprint contains a collection of other containers.

###### Control blueprints
A special kind of blueprint that contains instructions on how to render a field to edit the attributes (values) of a container.

Controls are only used inside Frontender Desktop and are not included in the page.

###### Adapters
An adapter is a connection to an API. An adapter is an extension package of
- PHP Models, which extend/implement Frontender Platform core adapter models,
- Control blueprints, which are used inside container blueprints and are used to set the model states

###### Templates
Templates are HTML instructions and may include other assets like CSS, JavaScript and Images. Templates are currently Twig files. Templates are stored in the space, but overrides on a site level may be supported in a future version.
