# Frontender introduction

### Container definition
A container (definition) is a JSON object. Containers may be nested to create compound containers. A page in Frontender is a compound container.
```JSON
{
    "name": "Name for Frontender",
    "description": "A description of the container for Frontender",
    "template":  "path/to/container/template.html.twig",
    "template_config": {},
    "containers": [],
    "blueprint": "a3248875-d0bf-4b0b-a496-0e1f0dec1f57"
}
```

A container may also be served in multiple languages.
```JSON
{
    "name": {
        "en-GB": "Name for Frontender",
        "fr-FR": "Nom pour Frontender",
        "es-ES": "Nombre para Frontender"
    },
    "description": {
        "en-GB": "A description of the container for Frontender",
        "fr-FR": "Une description du conteneur pour Frontender",
        "es-ES": "Una descripción del contenedor para el Frontender"
    },
    "template":  "path/to/container/template.html.twig",
    "template_config": {},
    "containers": [],
    "blueprint": "a3248875-d0bf-4b0b-a496-0e1f0dec1f57"
}
```

| Term  | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Name | the name of the container definition, only visible to Frontender. |
| Description | the description of the container definition, only visible to Frontender. |
| Template | the file path of the template, this template will be used to render the container in the frontend. |
| Config | the configuration object used by the template to render the container. This object may contain model instructions as well as configuration instructions. |
| Containers | additional containers that may be included in the template. |
| Blueprint | A blueprint ID is automatically generated when the container is saved as a blueprint. Do not enter a blueprint ID yourself. |
| Route | The path where the page will live. Should not be prefixed with a forward slash. |

### Blueprint definition
A blueprint (definition) is like a container. Blueprints have controls that allow Frontender Desktop to render the configuration UI used to edit the container instructions (config). Blueprints are used as a template to create containers. They are pre-formatted to container useful default settings that can be overridden once they have been included onto a page.


### Page definitions
A page (definition) is a (compound) container. A page commonly consists of a header, body and footer container and may look like:
```JSON
{
    "route": "blog",
    "name": {
        "en-GB": "Name for Frontender"
    },
    "description": {
        "en-GB": "A description of the container for Frontender"
    },
    "template": "path/to/page/template.html.twig",
    "template_config": {},
    "containers": [
        {
            "frontender": "1558357549",
            "name": {
                "en-GB": "Header container"
            },
            "description": {
                "en-GB": "A description for Frontender"
            },
            "template": "path/to/header/template.html.twig",
            "template_config": {
                "content": {
					"label": {
						"en-GB": "Content"
					},
					"controls": {
						"headline": {
							"label": {
								"en-GB": "Headline"
							},
							"value": {
								"en-GB": "What will you do with Frontender?"
							},
							"control": "core/text"
						},
						"standfirst": {
							"label": {
								"en-GB": "Standfirst"
							},
							"value": {
								"en-GB": "How will you empower your team with Frontender?"
							},
							"control": "core/text"
						},
						"body": {
							"label": {
								"en-GB": "Body text"
							},
							"value": [
								{
									"en-GB": "Tell us your vision in a few words, and we’ll get in touch to share ideas."
								}
							],
							"control": "core/textarea",
							"repeatable": true
						}
					}
				}
            },
            "containers": [],
            "blueprint": "ea6b893c-de10-47d6-9370-1ecddf011e58"
        },
        {
            "frontender": "1558357550",
            "name": {
                "en-GB": "Body container"
            },
            "description": {
                "en-GB": "A description for Frontender"
            },
            "template": "path/to/body/template.html.twig",
            "template_config": {},
            "Containers": [],
            "blueprint": "ea6b893c-de10-47d6-9370-1ecddf011e58"
        },
        {
            "frontender": "1558357551",
            "name": {
                "en-GB": "Footer container"
            },
            "description": {
                "en-GB": "A description for Frontender"
            },
            "template": "path/to/footer/template.html.twig",
            "template_config": {},
            "blueprint": "ea6b893c-de10-47d6-9370-1ecddf011e58",
            "containers": []
        }
    ],
    "blueprint": "a3248875-d0bf-4b0b-a496-0e1f0dec1f57",
    "frontender": "1558357552"
}
```

### Scope definition
Each site has access to 2 scopes by default. Additional scopes may be purchased by the space owner. More information about pricing can be found on <a href="https://getfrontender.com/pricing" target="&#95;blank">getfrontender.com</a>.

### Page states
A page has different states that define its access:

###### Published
The revision of the page that is accessible to the frontend. It is stored in the Pages.public Collection (see: [Collections](/collection.html)).

###### Revision
A previous version of a page. It is stored in the Pages Collection (see: [Collections](/collection.html)). A revision is a complete page definition that can be loaded and previewed in Frontender Desktop and Frontender Platform(using its UUID). A revision is not publicly accessible to the frontend. A revision is defined by a date and time.

Revisions are managed in Frontender.

A revision of a page definition contains a MD5 hash of the page definition’s config attribute (which contains the actual container object).

###### Draft
A non-persisted version of a page. The draft is the working copy of a page. A draft is persisted in some kind of memory storage and is destroyed when:

- The user navigates away without saving
- The application is closed without saving
- The drafted page is removed
- …

Drafts are not accessible outside the user’s installation of Frontender. A draft is not accessible by the frontend and can not be previewed in a browser.

When a user wishes to preview a draft in the browser, it must be saved first to create a revision of it.

Opening a (public) revision with Frontender Desktop will generate a draft.

###### Trash
A revision lot (all versions of a page) that have been moved to the pages.trash collection. Pages in the trash will be retrievable (in some future version of Frontender).

### Container and blueprint attributes
Pages, containers and blueprints are JSON objects that contain configuration on which template to render, how, and with what data.

- A **blueprint contains controls** (with default or custom values)
- A **container contains values** (and optionally a reference to a blueprint)

If a blueprint attribute is not included in the container, the container will still function but its values can only be edited in Code view.

Likewise, when a container contains a property that cannot be matched to a control in a referenced blueprint, its value will only be editable in the Code view.

A value can be expressed as a simple value (string, number or boolean), an object with {locale}/{simple value} pairs or an array of values (see: [Blueprints::controls](/blueprints.html)).

When a value is a simple value, it is considered non-translatable and will be used for all locales.

#### Template path (required)
The template.path attribute is exposed to the frontend. It can consist of values for each of one supported locales in the frontend. It defines what template (markup) will be used to render the page.
The page will not work without a template path.

- _In Frontender, when a container does not contain a value for template, it is invalid and a notification should be displayed upon saving the file (or while editing its JSON)._
- _On the frontend, when a container does not contain a value for template, it can not be rendered and will simply be ignored by the JSON parser and discarded in the rendering process._

```JSON
{
    "template": {
        "en-GB": "project_name/container/template.html.twig",
        "en-US": "project_name/container/template.html.twig"
    }
}
```

#### Name
The name attribute is only exposed to Frontender. It can consist of values for each of one supported locale in Frontender.

Name is a required attribute, the user will be prompted to enter a name value if the value is empty upon save.

```JSON
{
    "name": {
        "en-GB": "My Frontender homepage",
        "en-US": "My Frontender homepage"
    }
}
```

#### Description
The description attribute is an optional attribute, it is only exposed to Frontender. It can consist of values for each of one supported locale in Frontender.

When description is omitted (or the value remains empty) the attribute is disregarded.

```JSON
{
    "description": {
        "en-GB": "Description in en_GB, String",
        "en-US": "Description in en_US, String"
    }
}
```

#### Template config
The template_config attribute holds configuration properties for rendering of the template.
Although template_config is not required, it's highly advised to use it.

Settings are grouped into different sections (one level). Each group will be rendered as a tab in the Frontender Desktop UI.

_Examples below are for a frontend in Dutch and English_

```JSON
{
    "template_config": {
        "model": {
            "name": "contentful/article",
            "id": "A68B45686AGB0"
        },
        "labels": {
            "label": {
                "en-GB": "Label configuration"
            },
            "controls": {
                "headline": {
                    "label": {
                        "en-GB": "Headline"
                    },
                    "value": {
                        "nl-NL": "Jouw volgende digitale stap",
                        "en-GB": "Your next step in digital"
                    }
                },
                "standfirst": {
                    "label": {
                        "en-GB": "Standfirst"
                    },
                    "value": {
                        "nl-NL": "",
                        "en-GB": ""    
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Blueprint
Blueprint is the reference to a blueprint that is to be used to render a container’s UI in Frontender Desktop.

A blueprint holds the controls for the value(s) in a container. (see: [Blueprint::controls](/blueprints.html)).


#### Route
The route attribute defines the page’s URL, e.g. its address to the browser:
```JSON
{
    "route": {
        "en-GB": "home",
        "en-US": "home"
    }
}
```

#### Containers
Containers is an array and consists of one or more nested containers. A container containing other containers is referred to as a compound containers. A container in a container array is referred to as a nested container.
```JSON
{
    "containers": []
}
```

#### Revision
Revision contains a date (when the revision was created), a hash (of all container attributes but omitting the revision attribute) and a user object (who saved the revision). At the moment of writing this document, a revision attribute is only used on page level (root page definition container).

```JSON
{
    "revision" : {
        "lot": "07156454-f83b-4f8e-ba8f-46417564f409",
        "date": "2018-04-20 00:00:00",
        "hash": "71e089512689b9f29ba26a3d8db5aac9",
        "user": {}
    }
}
```
