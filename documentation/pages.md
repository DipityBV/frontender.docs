## Pages

### Page types
1. [Global page](#global-page)
2. [Item page](#item-page)
3. [Search page](#search-page)

##### Global page
Pages with standalone containers. Every container works without global configuration. There is no further connection between the containers on a global page.

##### Item page
A page configured for a relative item. An item ID is required for this page to work as intended.
Containers on this page generally won't work without a globally configured item ID. 

##### Search page
Page configured as a SERP. Search Engine Results Pages (SERP) are the pages displayed by search engines in response to a query by a searcher. The main component of the SERP is the listing of results that are returned by the search engine in response to a keyword query, although the pages may also contain other results such as advertisements.
